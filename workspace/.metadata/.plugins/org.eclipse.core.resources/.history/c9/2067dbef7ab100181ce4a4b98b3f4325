Throne Room
The room is decrepit. The tile floors are cracked and moss grows near puddles formed by the rainwater dripping from the ceiling. An old throne sits vacant at the head of the room, facing the abandoned hall.

Royal Chamber
Nearly everything of value has been taken by the former hosts or burgled. The covers on the bed have been torn off of the damp mattress and every drawer and cupboard hangs open.

Drawing Room
You can only walk so far into the room. Most of the floor has collapsed into lower levels, wood, stone, and broken furniture scattered below. You consider whether to jump down, but decide against it.
Exits: east
Items: wooden debris, stone debris

Rooftops
You manage to clamber up the rugged stone wall through a hole in the ceiling. Now on the roof, you can see the water from the rainfall forming puddles and streams that drip onto the room below. The sky is still cloudy from the storm. It's getting dark out.
